// JSX  ia a syntax extension for Java Script that allows developers to
//      write HTML like structures within the Java Script code.


// IT IS USED BECAUSE;
// it  deefines the structure  and appearance  of user interface components
// it provides a declarative way to describe the desired UI, making it easier to visualize and maintain
// JSX enhances code readability and developer experience.
// JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} enabling dynamic content
//     rendering based on props, state, or other data.
// JSX simplifies the process of creating and updating UI elements by abstracting away the complexities of 
//     direct DOM manipulation.


// state is managed within a component, while props are passed from a parent component to a child component
//  state are Mutable (can be changed within the component), while props are Immutable (read-only within the child)


// Hooks are functions that allow functional components to access React state and lifecycle features.
